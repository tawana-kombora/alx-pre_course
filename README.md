# Readme for the alx-pre_course repo

I'm only allowed to use the Github Interface to edit this file **once**!!
That's Wild to me but I've concluded why one would be requested to act like this.
Assuming you actually want to be a software engineer it is important to be comfortable with the terminal.

You may - one day - end up ssh'ing into a machine that's someplace else.
You'll find yourself without a GUI interface and just a terminal.
At that point you'd feel amazing for knowing it.
The learning curve is steep though.

Practising the git + GitHub workflow though practical examples is smart.
It reinforces the learning and gives you a massive sense of accomplishment.
Though I will say that the terminal + git together is a scary combination when you're first-timer.
